                    Calcium is not only important for bone health, however
                    also helps brain development. The body needs calcium
                    so that muscles can move and help nerves carry messages
                    from the brain to the whole body. Calcium also helps vessels

                      Set limits for children to surf online starting from time, 
                      what sites and applications they can visit, 
                      as well as the attitude they need to adopt when interacting online.
                      Mothers can also activate the parental control feature via special 
                      software on their gadget (cellphone or laptop) which functions to 
                      filter or block certain web content that is not suitable for children.

                      Give examples of wise behavior in interacting with the digital world.
                      For example, don't hold the gadget when your child is asking you to
                      play or asking for special attention. Children are great imitators,
                      so limit your online activities, Mom.

                      Engaging in online activities with children can encourage social interaction, 
                      bonding, and learning. Doing screen time activities together can also be an opportunity 
                      to share good experiences and perspectives on life with children. 
                      Playing games together can be a way to show sportsmanship and game ethics.

                      To prevent children from experiencing unwanted things from digital use, 
                      mothers should actively provide information related to cyber security. 
                      For example, ask children not to provide personal information before getting permission 
                      from their parents when accessing some sites.
